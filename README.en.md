# Boost your web game startup!

In H5 games, launch time is a critical factor influencing user retention and conversion. Besides the `total package size`, the `number of network requests` is another key factor, especially in regions like Southeast Asia, where internet speeds and hardware capabilities are often limited.

The extension for Cocos Creator 3.x packages all resource files (e.g., PNG, JPG, ASTC, WebP, JSON, CCOBN) into a ZIP file to reduce network requests and speed up the game's loading time.
